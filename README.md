## 1. Executive Summary and Problem Statement

### 🌾 The PMFBY Challenge
The **Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)** is one of the world's largest crop insurance schemes, shielding millions of Indian farmers against unavoidable natural calamities. However, its real-world implementation faces severe bottlenecks:

1. **Slow & Subjective Damage Assessments**: Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) and manual physical surveys take months, leaving distressed farmers without emergency working capital.
2. **High Dispute Rates & Lack of Transparency**: Disagreements between farmers, local revenue authorities, and insurance companies over assessed yield loss and claim percentages lead to prolonged litigation.
3. **Complex Actuarial Calculations & Information Asymmetry**: Farmers rarely know how their premiums are calculated, how much government subsidy is applied, or what their fair market value is at harvest.
4. **Data Tampering & Trust Deficits**: Audit trails for filed claims and policy records are vulnerable to retrospective tampering or administrative loss.

### 🛡️ The AgriShield Solution
**AgriShield** reinvents PMFBY as a fully automated, transparent, multi-tenant digital ecosystem:
- **Instant GPS Land Boundary Registry**: Farmers register farm boundaries using GPS or interactive satellite map tracing; geometries are authoritatively validated server-side using **PostGIS** and **PyProj Geodesic ellipsoids**.
- **Multi-Modal AI Health & Damage Diagnostics**: Post-disaster mobile photos are assessed within seconds using **EfficientNet-B0** deep learning models trained on agricultural damage and disease datasets.
- **Satellite & Hyper-Local Agro-Meteorology**: Ingests **Copernicus Sentinel-2** multispectral imagery (NDVI, NDWI, NDMI), **OpenWeatherMap** precipitation/temperature cycles, and **SoilHive / OCR** soil chemistry metrics.
- **Automated PMFBY Statutory Pricing**: Dynamic actuarial quoting engine strictly enforcing the statutory **1.5% Rabi**, **2.0% Kharif**, and **5.0% Commercial** farmer caps while computing real-time Central & State government subsidies.
- **Agmarknet Live Mandi Pricing**: Direct integration with official `data.gov.in` Mandi rates, predicting seasonal harvest revenue in INR per quintal.
- **Cryptographic Blockchain Ledger**: Every policy issuance and claim decision is serialized into a canonical SHA-256 hash and permanently recorded on the **Polygon Amoy testnet** smart contract, giving farmers and auditors verifiable proof of record.

## 3. System Architecture and Data Flow

AgriShield operates on a clean separation of concerns across five distinct tiers:

### Architectural Guardrails
1. **Single Point of Ingestion**: Neither the Flutter mobile app nor the React web dashboard ever communicates directly with the AI engine (`ai/`) or PostgreSQL. All interactions route through `backend/` (`http://localhost:8000/api/v1`).
2. **AI Microservice Isolation**: `ai/` runs on port `8001` as a pure computational microservice without authentication or direct database writes. Model versions and confidence metrics are always returned.
3. **Dual-Mode Graceful Degradation**: Both `ai/` and `backend/` support an automatic `MOCK_MODE=true` toggle. If an external satellite or weather API is rate-limited or unavailable, the system transparently falls back to pre-computed statistical benchmarks without breaking UI execution.

## 5. End-to-End Operational Workflows

### 🌾 Workflow A: Farmer Onboarding & Land Boundary Registration
1. **Frictionless Login**: The farmer inputs their phone number on the Flutter app. The backend upserts the record into the `users` table with `role='farmer'` and returns a JWT.
2. **Boundary Drawing**: The farmer uses the in-app satellite map to trace boundary vertices or walks the field perimeter with GPS enabled.
3. **Pre-Submission Check**: `validate_farm_boundary()` verifies the ring is closed ($\ge 4$ points), has no self-intersections, and computes the geodesic surface area on the WGS84 ellipsoid.
4. **Authoritative Server Ingestion**: `POST /farms` validates the geometry, creates a PostGIS polygon record, calculates the exact area in square meters and hectares, and binds the farm to `user_id`.
5. **Instant Synchronization**: The farm immediately appears in the web portal's **Farmers** directory and **FarmsMap** with owner details joined.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Farmer as "👨‍🌾 Farmer (Flutter App)"
    participant Backend as "⚙️ Integration API (FastAPI)"
    participant PostGIS as "🗄️ PostgreSQL / PostGIS"
    actor Admin as "🏢 Insurer Admin (React Web)"

    Farmer->>Backend: POST /auth/register-or-login { phone }
    Backend->>PostGIS: SELECT / INSERT User (Phone anchor)
    Backend-->>Farmer: JWT Access Token + User Profile

    Farmer->>Backend: POST /farms { name, crop, boundary: GeoPolygon }
    Backend->>Backend: Validate Geometry (Closed, No Self-Intersection, PyProj Geod Area)
    Backend->>PostGIS: INSERT INTO farms (user_id, boundary, area_m2, status='PENDING')
    Backend-->>Farmer: 201 Created { farm_id, area_m2 }

    Admin->>Backend: GET /admin/farmers & GET /farms
    Backend->>PostGIS: SELECT farms JOIN users ON farms.user_id = users.id
    Backend-->>Admin: Returns Farm with Owner Name, Phone & Boundary Coordinates
```

---

### 💰 Workflow B: Actuarial Pricing, Policy Purchase & Blockchain Timestamping
1. **Quote Request**: The farmer or insurer requests an insurance quote for a registered farm.
2. **Actuarial Calculation**: `pricing_service.py` evaluates the crop category (Rabi, Kharif, or Commercial), retrieves state scales of finance, and computes:
   - $\text{Sum Insured} = \text{Area (ha)} \times \text{Scale of Finance (INR/ha)}$
   - $\text{Farmer Premium} = \text{Sum Insured} \times \text{Statutory Cap \% (1.5\%, 2.0\%, or 5.0\%)}$
   - $\text{Govt Subsidy} = \text{Gross Actuarial Premium} - \text{Farmer Premium}$
3. **Policy Purchase**: `POST /insurance/policies` records an active policy bound to `farm_id` and `user_id`.
4. **Canonical State Hashing**: The policy's immutable parameters are serialized into sorted JSON and hashed with SHA-256:
   ```text
   canonical_hash = SHA-256(SortKeys({policy_id, user_id, farm_id, premium, coverage}))
   ```
5. **On-Chain Recording**: `blockchain_service.py` transmits the canonical hash to `AgriShieldRecords.sol` on Polygon Amoy, storing the resulting transaction hash (`tx_hash`) in the database.
6. **Notification**: A confirmation notification is automatically added to the farmer's inbox.

---

### 🚨 Workflow C: Disaster Claim Filing, AI Assessment & Claim Settlement
1. **Disaster Filing**: Following an extreme weather event (flood, hailstorm, drought), the farmer files a claim via Flutter, uploading photos and incident details with an `Idempotency-Key`.
2. **Automated AI Damage Assessment**: The backend immediately routes the evidence photo to `ai/` (`POST /v1/damage-assessment`), where an **EfficientNet-B0** model computes the damage percentage (e.g., 68.5%) and confidence score.
3. **State Hashing & Audit Update**: The claim moves to status `AI_ASSESSED`. A canonical hash is generated from the assessment payload and timestamped on-chain.
4. **Insurer Review Queue**: The claim appears in the React portal's **Claims** queue with full photographic evidence, AI damage quantification, and the farmer's policy details.
5. **One-Click Human Adjudication**: The insurer clicks **Approve** or **Reject** (`POST /claims/{id}/review`).
6. **Reactive Notification**: The backend updates the claim status, sets `reviewed_by` and `reviewed_at`, and automatically creates a `claim_status` notification for the farmer.
7. **Farmer Timeline Update**: The farmer's in-app 4-stage claim timeline advances in real time:
   > **Claim Audit Lifecycle**: `Submitted` ➔ `AI Assessed` ➔ `Insurer Reviewed` ➔ `Blockchain Timestamped`

    Backend->>Chain: addRecord(canonicalHash)
    Chain-->>Backend: Returns tx_hash (0xabc...)
    Backend->>Backend: Update claim (status='AI_ASSESSED', tx_hash)
    Backend->>Backend: INSERT INTO notifications (claim_status)

    Insurer->>Backend: GET /claims (Sees claim with AI preview)
    Insurer->>Backend: POST /claims/{id}/review { action: 'APPROVE' }
    Backend->>Backend: UPDATE claims SET status='APPROVED'
    Backend->>Backend: INSERT INTO notifications ("Claim Approved!")
    
    Farmer->>App: Opens claim timeline
    App->>Backend: GET /notifications & GET /claims/{id}
    App-->>Farmer: Displays green checkmark on "Insurer Reviewed"
```

## 6. Backend Integration Engine (`backend/`)

The Backend serves as the single source of truth, implemented using **FastAPI** with asynchronous SQLAlchemy, PostGIS spatial queries, and Web3 smart contract dispatchers.

  Validates GeoJSON polygon boundary rings. Checks for closure, vertex count, non-intersection using Shapely `is_valid`, and computes true ellipsoidal surface area using `pyproj.Geod(ellps="WGS84")`. Enforces a strict minimum size ($100\text{ m}^2$) and maximum size ($10,000\text{ ha}$).
- **`services/pricing_service.py`**:
  Encapsulates official PMFBY underwriting rules:
  - Scales of finance for central India (Wheat: ₹60,000/ha, Soybean: ₹50,000/ha, Paddy: ₹68,000/ha, Cotton: ₹85,000/ha, Sugarcane: ₹1,20,000/ha).
  - Categorizes seasons automatically (Rabi 2025-26, Kharif 2026, Annual Commercial).
  - Generates transparent breakdowns of gross premium vs. farmer premium vs. government subsidy.
- **`services/agmarknet_client.py`**:
  Fetches live Mandi spot commodity rates from the Government of India's Open Data Platform (`data.gov.in`). Implements local session caching with verified MSP benchmark rates (e.g., Wheat at ₹2,425/quintal, Soybean at ₹4,892/quintal) for high-availability resilience.
- **`services/blockchain_service.py`**:
  Asynchronously computes canonical deterministic SHA-256 digests and submits them to the Polygon Amoy testnet contract using `web3.py`. If Polygon testnet RPC encounters network congestion, generates an instant deterministic fallback hash to guarantee uninterrupted API operation.

#### Mathematical Formulations & Characteristic Weights
The ground-truth agricultural training physics models yield as a base crop capacity modulated by environmental multipliers and abiotic stress penalties:

1. **Crop Baseline Potential ($Y_{\text{base}}$)**:
   - Soybean: $2.7\text{ t/ha}$ | Wheat: $3.6\text{ t/ha}$ | Rice: $4.1\text{ t/ha}$
   - Maize: $4.4\text{ t/ha}$ | Cotton: $1.8\text{ t/ha}$ | Chickpea: $2.1\text{ t/ha}$

2. **Soil Quality Score ($S_{\text{soil}}$)** (Weight: $0.20$):

   $S_{\text{soil}} = 0.55 + 0.20 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Nitrogen}}{300.0}\right) + 0.10 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Phosphorus}}{30.0}\right) + 0.10 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Potassium}}{200.0}\right)$

3. **Precipitation Suitability ($S_{\text{rain}}$)** (Weight: $0.20$, Gaussian centered at $700\text{ mm}$):

   $S_{\text{rain}} = \exp\left( -\left(\frac{\text{Rainfall} - 700}{350}\right)^2 \right)$

4. **Thermal Suitability ($S_{\text{temp}}$)** (Weight: $0.20$, Gaussian centered at $27^\circ\text{C}$):

   $S_{\text{temp}} = \exp\left( -\left(\frac{T_{\text{mean}} - 27}{7}\right)^2 \right)$

5. **Remote Sensing Vegetation Vigor ($S_{\text{veg}}$)** (Weight: $0.45$):

   $S_{\text{veg}} = 0.55 + 0.75 \cdot (\text{NDVI}_{\text{mean}} - 0.55) + 0.35 \cdot \text{NDMI}_{\text{mean}} + 0.15 \cdot (\text{NDWI}_{\text{mean}} + 0.15)$

6. **Stress Penalties ($P_{\text{stress}}$)**:
   - Heat Stress Penalty: $P_{\text{heat}} = 0.035 \times \text{Heat Stress Days}$
   - Flood Stress Penalty: $P_{\text{flood}} = 0.020 \times \text{Excessive Rainfall Index}$
   - Sowing Delay Penalty: $P_{\text{sow}} = 0.008 \times \max(\text{Sowing Delay Days}, 0)$
   - Aggregate Abiotic Penalty: $P_{\text{stress}} = P_{\text{heat}} + P_{\text{flood}} + P_{\text{sow}}$

7. **Composite Yield Formulation**:

   $\text{Multiplier} = \text{clip}\Big(0.65 + 0.20 S_{\text{soil}} + 0.20 S_{\text{rain}} + 0.20 S_{\text{temp}} + 0.45 S_{\text{veg}} - P_{\text{stress}},\ 0.35,\ 1.45\Big)$

   $\text{Yield}_{\text{t/ha}} = \text{clip}\Big( Y_{\text{base}} \times \text{Multiplier} + \mathcal{N}(0, 0.22),\ 0.2,\ 8.5 \Big)$

#### Ensemble Confidence Metric Calculation
At inference time, confidence is derived dynamically from the **inter-tree coefficient of variation ($\text{CV}$)** across all 300 decision tree estimators ($T_1, T_2, \dots, T_{300}$):

$$
\mu_{\text{trees}} = \frac{1}{300} \sum_{i=1}^{300} T_i(x), \quad \sigma_{\text{trees}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{300} \sum_{i=1}^{300} \big(T_i(x) - \mu_{\text{trees}}\big)^2}
$$

$$
\text{CV} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{trees}}}{\mu_{\text{trees}} + \epsilon}, \quad \text{Confidence} = \text{clip}(1.0 - \text{CV},\ 0.0,\ 1.0)
$$

*If $\text{Confidence} \lt 0.70$, the prediction is automatically flagged with `low_confidence: true`.*

#### The 5 Latent Risk Component Formulations & Weights
The latent risk score aggregates 5 independent risk pillars:

$$
\text{Latent Score} = \mathcal{R}_{\text{weather}} + \mathcal{R}_{\text{crop}} + \mathcal{R}_{\text{moisture}} + \mathcal{R}_{\text{soil}} + \mathcal{R}_{\text{historical}}
$$

1. **Weather Hazard Component ($\mathcal{R}_{\text{weather}}$)** (Effective Weight: $25\%$):

   $\mathcal{R}_{\text{weather}} = 0.30 \cdot \text{clip}\left(\frac{\text{Heat Stress Days}}{10}, 0, 1\right) + 0.20 \cdot \text{clip}\left(\frac{\text{Excessive Rain Index}}{8}, 0, 1\right)$

2. **Crop Health & Biological Component ($\mathcal{R}_{\text{crop}}$)** (Effective Weight: $35\%$):

   $\mathcal{R}_{\text{crop}} = 0.35 \cdot \text{Disease Probability} + 0.35 \cdot \text{clip}\left(\frac{0.75 - \text{NDVI}_{\text{mean}}}{0.50}, 0, 1\right)$

   Where Disease Probability is computed through logistic activation of climatic factors:

   $z_{\text{disease}} = -2.0 + 0.035(\text{Humidity} - 65) + 0.45\left(\frac{R_{\text{7d}}}{50}\right) - 2.0(\text{NDVI} - 0.55) + 0.08(T_{\text{mean}} - 25)$

   $\text{Disease Probability} = \text{clip}\left(\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z_{\text{disease}}}},\ 0.01,\ 0.98\right)$

3. **Moisture Stress Component ($\mathcal{R}_{\text{moisture}}$)** (Effective Weight: $20\%$):

   $\mathcal{R}_{\text{moisture}} = 0.25 \cdot \text{clip}\left(\frac{0.05 - \text{NDMI}_{\text{mean}}}{0.40}, 0, 1\right)$

4. **Soil Degradation Component ($\mathcal{R}_{\text{soil}}$)** (Effective Weight: $20\%$):
   - $\text{pH Risk} = \text{clip}\left(\frac{|\text{Soil pH} - 6.7|}{1.8}, 0, 1\right)$
   - $\text{Nutrient Risk} = \text{clip}\left(1.0 - \frac{\frac{\text{N}}{300} + \frac{\text{P}}{30} + \frac{\text{K}}{200}}{3}, 0, 1\right)$
   - $\mathcal{R}_{\text{soil}} = 0.20 \cdot \text{pH Risk} + 0.20 \cdot \text{Nutrient Risk}$

5. **Historical Exposure Component ($\mathcal{R}_{\text{historical}}$)** (Effective Weight: $25\%$):

   $\mathcal{R}_{\text{historical}} = 0.25 \cdot \text{Historical Loss Rate}$

#### Final Sigmoidal Risk Scaling
The composite latent score is passed through a steep logistic function calibrated to Indian agricultural conditions:

$$
\text{Raw Score} = \text{clip}\Big(100.0 \cdot \sigma\big(5.0 \cdot (\text{Latent Score} - 0.38)\big) + \mathcal{N}(0, 4.0),\ 0.0,\ 100.0\Big)
$$

$$
\text{API Risk Score} = \frac{\text{Raw Score}}{100.0} \in [0.0,\ 1.0]
$$

#### Risk Band Classification
| Risk Band | Score Interval | PMFBY Actuarial Interpretation | Insurance Pricing Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LOW` | `0.00 – 0.25` | Optimal microclimate, healthy vigor, balanced soil | Standard statutory rate (1.5% - 2.0%) |
| `MEDIUM` | `0.25 – 0.50` | Minor moisture deficit or historical loss history | Standard statutory rate; advisory warnings |
| `HIGH` | `0.50 – 0.75` | Significant pathogen pressure, heat stress, or pH deviation | Elevated underwriting scrutiny; premium surcharge |
| `CRITICAL` | `0.75 – 1.00` | Severe drought, waterlogging inundation, or crop failure | Mandatory field validation; expedited claim reserve |

#### Inference-Time Factor Attribution Decomposition
`_derive_factors(features)` inspects the exact physical values and dynamically produces human-readable contributing factors with quantitative weights:
- **Flood Hazard**: If $\text{Rainfall} \gt 1100\text{ mm} \implies \text{Contribution} = \min(0.35, (\text{Rainfall} - 1100) / 1000)$.
- **Drought Hazard**: If $\text{Rainfall} \lt 300\text{ mm} \implies \text{Contribution} = \min(0.30, (300 - \text{Rainfall}) / 600)$.
- **Heat Stress**: If $T_{\text{mean}} \gt 35^\circ\text{C} \implies \text{Contribution} = \min(0.25, (T_{\text{mean}} - 35) / 28)$.
- **Vegetative Deficit**: If $\text{NDVI} \lt 0.40 \implies \text{Contribution} = \min(0.30, (0.40 - \text{NDVI}) / 0.40)$.
- **Disease Hazard**: If $\text{Disease Prob} \gt 0.35 \implies \text{Contribution} = \min(0.40, \text{Disease Prob} \times 0.50)$.
- **Waterlogging**: If $\text{NDWI} \gt 0.25 \implies \text{Contribution} = \min(0.25, (\text{NDWI} - 0.25) / 0.55)$.
- **Moisture Deficit**: If $\text{NDMI} \lt 0.05 \implies \text{Contribution} = \min(0.20, (0.05 - \text{NDMI}) / 0.45)$.
- **pH Deviation**: If $|\text{pH} - 6.7| \gt 1.0 \implies \text{Contribution} = \min(0.20, |\text{pH} - 6.7| / 3.6)$.
- **Nutrient Deficit**: If $\text{Nutrient Index} \lt 0.60 \implies \text{Contribution} = \min(0.30, (1.0 - \text{Nutrient Index}) \times 0.40)$.

### 7.4 Model 4: Post-Disaster Damage Assessment and Loss Quantification

#### Architecture & Quantification Setup
- **Backbone**: **EfficientNet-B0** pre-trained on ImageNet-1k.
- **Model File**: `ai/models/damage/model.pt` (Weights Size: **16.32 MB**).
- **Classes**: `non_damaged` vs. `damaged`.
- **Head Replacement**: `nn.Linear(1280, 2)`.
- **Training Regimen**:
  - Augmentations: Random horizontal & vertical flips, random rotation ($\pm 20^\circ$), color jitter (brightness 0.3, contrast 0.3, saturation 0.2).
  - Loss: `CrossEntropyLoss` with label smoothing ($0.1$).
- **Damage Percentage Mapping (`DAMAGE_PCT_MAP`)**:
  - `non_damaged`: $0.0\%$ base damage.
  - `damaged`: $60.0\%$ base damage, scaled dynamically by the softmax prediction probability $P(\text{damaged})$:

     $\text{Damage \%} = \text{round}\Big(P(\text{damaged}) \times 65.0\% + \Delta_{\text{calamity}},\ 1\Big)$

    Where $\Delta_{\text{calamity}}$ applies empirical severity offsets based on incident type (Hailstorm: $+15\%$, Severe Flood: $+20\%$, Drought: $+10\%$).
- **Cryptographic Claim Seal**: The output damage percentage and model confidence are immediately formatted into the canonical JSON dictionary and signed on Polygon Amoy.

### 7.5 Model 5: Soil Health Card OCR Parser

#### Architecture & Extraction Logic
- **Detector**: CRAFT (Character Region Awareness for Text Detection) deep neural network (`craft_mlt_25k.pth`).
- **Recognizer**: Standard PyTorch CTC convolutional recurrent neural network (`english_g2.pth`).
- **Inference Pipeline (`ai/app/routes/soil_ocr.py`)**:
  1. Ingests uploaded image or PDF scan of the Government of India **Soil Health Card**.
  2. Runs text detection and text bounding box grouping across regional layouts.
  3. Executes case-insensitive regex pattern matching against key chemical markers:
     - **Nitrogen (N)**: `r"(?:nitrogen|available\s*N)[^\d]*(\d+\.?\d*)"`
     - **Phosphorus (P)**: `r"(?:phosphorus|available\s*P)[^\d]*(\d+\.?\d*)"`
     - **Potassium (K)**: `r"(?:potassium|available\s*K)[^\d]*(\d+\.?\d*)"`
     - **pH Value**: `r"pH[^\d]*(\d+\.?\d*)"`
  4. **Dynamic Confidence Formula**:

      $\text{Found Count} = \sum_{k \in \{N, P, K, pH\}} \mathbb{I}(k \text{ extracted successfully})$
      $\text{OCR Confidence} = 0.50 + \left(\frac{\text{Found Count}}{4}\right) \times 0.45$

  5. **High-Availability Fallback**: If any nutrient value cannot be resolved due to document degradation, the service transparently injects agro-climatic regional baseline averages ($\text{N}: 45.0\text{ kg/ha}, \text{P}: 22.0\text{ kg/ha}, \text{K}: 180.0\text{ kg/ha}, \text{pH}: 6.5$) while flagging the confidence accordingly.

### 7.6 Model 6: Agronomic Advisory and Crop Recommendation Expert System

#### Decision Logic for Sown vs. Unsown Plots
Implemented in `ai/app/routes/advisory.py`, the advisory engine operates in two operational modes:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start["Farm Context Ingestion"] --> SownCheck{"Is Plot Sown?"}
    
    SownCheck -->|"Sown Field"| SownAdvisory["Crop-Specific Agronomic Protocols"]
    SownAdvisory --> StageAdvisory["Tillering / Flowering / Pod Filling Recommendations"]
    SownAdvisory --> EnvWarnings["Environmental Abiotic Stress Checks"]
    
    SownCheck -->|"Unsown / Fallow"| SeasonCheck{"Weather & Soil Conditions"}
    SeasonCheck -->|"Rainfall > 100mm OR Temp > 28°C"| KharifRec["Kharif Suite: Soybean Primary, Paddy, Cotton, Maize"]
    SeasonCheck -->|"Temp < 22°C"| RabiRec["Rabi Suite: Wheat Primary, Gram, Mustard"]
    SeasonCheck -->|"Moderate / Transitional"| TransRec["Transitional Suite: Soybean, Gram, Maize"]
    
    KharifRec --> PrepAdvisory["Deep Summer Ploughing & FYM Dressing"]
    RabiRec --> PrepAdvisory
    TransRec --> PrepAdvisory
```

#### Environmental Hazard Rules Engine
The engine evaluates real-time ambient metrics to trigger automated agronomic warnings:
- **Excessive Precipitation Warning**: If $\text{Rainfall} \gt 150\text{ mm} \implies$ *"Excess rainfall detected — ensure field drainage channels are cleared to prevent root hypoxia."*
- **Extreme Heat Stress Warning**: If $T_{\text{mean}} \gt 38^\circ\text{C} \implies$ *"Heat stress risk — schedule protective evening sprinkler irrigation to avoid blossom drop."*
- **Severe Soil Acidity Warning**: If $\text{pH} \lt 5.5 \implies$ *"Soil pH too acidic — apply agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) at 2–4 t/ha before next sowing cycle."*
- **Soil Alkalinity Warning**: If $\text{pH} \gt 8.0 \implies$ *"Alkaline soil detected — apply agricultural gypsum (calcium sulfate) and green manure."*
- **Nitrogen Starvation Warning**: If $\text{N} \lt 20\text{ kg/ha} \implies$ *"Severe Nitrogen deficit — top-dress urea at 60 kg/ha split across two applications."*
- **Phosphorus Starvation Warning**: If $\text{P} \lt 10\text{ kg/ha} \implies$ *"Phosphorus deficiency detected — apply Single Super Phosphate (SSP) or DAP directly at root zone."*

### 7.7 Data Harvesting and Remote Sensing Pipelines

#### 1. Copernicus Sentinel-2 Multispectral Ingestion (`ai/collection/satellite/`)
- Interacts with Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem via STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) APIs.
- Queries Cloudless ($\text{Cloud Cover} < 20\%$) L2A Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance tiles over the farm's PostGIS bounding box.
- Computes pixel-level vegetation indices across a 45-day temporal look-back window:
  - **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**: Sensitive to chlorophyll absorption:

    $\text{NDVI} = \frac{\text{Band 8 (NIR)} - \text{Band 4 (Red)}}{\text{Band 8 (NIR)} + \text{Band 4 (Red)}}$

  - **NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)**: Sensitive to surface waterlogging and flood inundation:

    $\text{NDWI} = \frac{\text{Band 8 (NIR)} - \text{Band 11 (SWIR-1)}}{\text{Band 8 (NIR)} + \text{Band 11 (SWIR-1)}}$

  - **NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index)**: Sensitive to crop canopy moisture stress:

    $\text{NDMI} = \frac{\text{Band 8 (NIR)} - \text{Band 12 (SWIR-2)}}{\text{Band 8 (NIR)} + \text{Band 12 (SWIR-2)}}$

#### 2. Agro-Meteorological Harvester (`ai/collection/weather/`)
- Fetches current weather observations and 5-day / 3-hour forecasts from OpenWeatherMap using the farm's centroid latitude and longitude.
- Aggregates rolling metrics: 7-day cumulative precipitation ($R_{\text{7d}}$), 30-day cumulative precipitation ($R_{\text{30d}}$), daily temperature amplitudes ($T_{\max} - T_{\min}$), and wind gust velocities.

#### 3. Soil Chemistry Harvester (`ai/collection/soil/`)
- Ingests digital soil profiles from the SoilHive API and ICAR Indian Soil Information System.
- Retrieves available macronutrients (N, P, K in $\text{kg/ha}$), soil organic carbon percentage ($\text{OC}\%$), electrical conductivity ($\text{EC}$), and pH at topsoil depths ($0 - 30\text{ cm}$).
